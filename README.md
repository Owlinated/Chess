# Chess (2015)
Chess project from computer graphics assignment.
Focus of this project is on generation of geometry from curves. All pieces, the clock and the table are generated from curves.
Also notable are reflections of the environment on the chess board and the real time shadows cast by all objects.
Fast Gaussian blur removes details of scene when overlays are rendered.
